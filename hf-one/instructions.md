# Headfirst Chapters 1 - 3

This is an exercise in __git__ as well as __javascript__.

## Instructions

1. If you haven't already, get a copy of my repository onto your local computer. There are two ways to do this.

	* If your group added collaborators to the forked repository you made in class on Wednesday, you can just *clone* that, as you have authentication on that repo.
	* If your group has NOT added you as a collaborator to their forked repo, that means you will either have to request collaborator access to that repo OR create your own forked version of my repository from [jmk2142/git-practice](https://github.com/jmk2142/git-practice).


2. On your local computer, create a file and using git, make a commit and push it to your Github repository.

	* Make sure your file is either an \*.md Markdown sample file OR a \*.js Javascript sample file of something you created. I don't really care what you create as long as it is a practice in Markdown or Javascript.


3. Then, by the end of Sunday, make a __pull-request__ to me to add your sample file to the main (original / my) repository.


4. On Monday evening or Tuesday morning, check out [jmk2142/git-practice](https://github.com/jmk2142/git-practice) to see what kind of updates were made to the original repository.

	* You'll find you do not have all these new files.
	* This means your repository (a branch off the original) is behind several commits.


5. You can __merge__ those commits on my branch into yours (your repository) by syncing the repos in Git Desktop.
